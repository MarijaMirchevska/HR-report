Data Model:
Before you start writing your measures and designing your report you should create your data model. 

Designing Report Consideration:
While you are building all report pages you need to try to pick best visualizations which will present your data best. 
Data analysis should start from Year 2012.
You can add Home page from where you can navigate to all different pages, also you can add navigation buttons from where you can go back, forward and to your Home page.
Feel free to add more pages where you will visualize other information that might be useful to have in your BI solution.
